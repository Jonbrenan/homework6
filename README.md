this is my project for homework 6


This application serves to gather weather information for a particular location. Specificially, it provides
the weather info on the current day and a five day forcast for the city entered into the search bar.

An extra feature is that the UV Index will have a colored coded background that lets the user know if there is a
low, medium or high level of UV rays in area.

A second feature is that all cities that are searched for are kept in a dynamically forming list. Initially, if any
of these buttons were clicked, it would show the weather information for that city. The information for this was supposed
to be in local storage, however I could not find a solution for this.

Installation

to install the application, one would go to the github link provoided in this README, download the link and run.
